# funny-verbs
A way to lear english verbs with a JS App

== I'm working on it ==

I had the idea of make funny the way to learn verbs,
since my children was trying to learn verbs in english
because the high-school.

I was inspired in Apps like Duolingo and sites like
freerice.com to create something that could help my sons.

First of all was the programming language, so I decided
the simplest way and what I knew, so then I chose javascript
in a web environment only in a front-end way.
