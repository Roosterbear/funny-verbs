### == I'm working on it ==
### ~~Functional~~

###### I had the idea of make a **funny way** to learn verbs,
###### since my children was trying to _learn verbs_ in english
###### because the high-school.

###### I was inspired in Apps like __Duolingo__ and sites like
###### __freerice.com__ to create something that could help my sons.

####### First of all was the programming language, so I decided
####### the simplest way and what I knew, so then I chose __javascript__
####### in a web environment only in a front-end way.
