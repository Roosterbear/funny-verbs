# Funny Verbs 😃 🗣️ 
## A way to learn english verbs with a JS App

I had an idea of make a __funny way__ to learn verbs in english, since my children was trying to learn them in the high-school.
<br />
I was inspired by Apps like __Duolingo__ and sites like __freerice.com__ to create something that could help my children.
<br />
The first thing I thought was, which programming language I will be using, so I decided the simplest way and the one I knew, so then I chose __javascript__ in a web environment only in a front-end way, so this is the end result.
<br />
If you want to add __new verbs__, you need to add the _image_ and _audio_ in a file with the same name of the verb in english, and add the words in the arrays "verbs" (english) and "verbos" (spanish).
