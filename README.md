# Funny Verbs 😃 🗣️ 
## A way to learn english verbs with a JS App

I had an idea of make a __funny way__ to learn verbs in english, since my children was trying to learn them in the high-school.

I was inspired in Apps like __Duolingo__ and sites like __freerice.com__ to create something that could help my sons.

The first thing I thought, was which programming language I will be using, so I decided the simplest way and what I knew, so then I chose __javascript__ in a web environment only in a front-end way, so this is the end result.
